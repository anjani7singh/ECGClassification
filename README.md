# ECG Arrhythmia classification using CNN:
Each ECG beat is considered separately and classified into one of the arrhythmia types. In this approach 2-D CNN is used and 2-D CNN takes images as input, due to that ECG beats are segmented and plotted using matplotlib, further this image is modified and resized to (128,128) using openCV.
